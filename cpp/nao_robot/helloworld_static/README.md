#Nao with cmake files (static)

This project and `helloworld_static` have been created to do the same 
purpose than the tutorial written in `README.md` which you can find in `/nao_robot`.

The difference is `nao_turorial` use directly the compiler gcc with 
the necessary flags to compile, and `helloworld_static` and `helloworld` 
are doing the same but using CMake.

`helloworld_static` is for having all the libraries static and `helloworld`
has only static libgcc libc++ and rapp.

In this example we'll run an RAPP API project in NAO robot. *Only using RAPP libraries*

##Code

In this example we are going to use the code of `available_services` example, 
because it's the easiest one. 

```cpp
#include <rapp/cloud/service_controller.hpp>
#include <rapp/cloud/available_services.hpp>
#include <iostream>
/*
 * \brief Example to show how available_services works
 */
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{

	rapp::cloud::platform info = {"155.207.19.229", "9001", "rapp_token"}; 
	rapp::cloud::service_controller ctrl(info);

	auto cb = [](std::vector<std::pair<std::string, std::string>> services) {
         std::cout << "available services: " << std::endl;
         for (const auto & pair : services) {
            std::cout << pair.first << " " << pair.second << std::endl;
         }
     };

    ctrl.make_call<rapp::cloud::available_services>(cb);
	return 0;
}
```

This is going to show all the services that you can use with RAPP API.

##CMakeLists

Like we said before, we are going to use only RAPP libraries, so this file will be similar to
`available_services` example.

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6)

project(helloworld_static)

add_executable(helloworld_static source/helloworld_static.cpp)

set(LIBRARY_PATH ${LIBRARY_PATH} /usr/local/lib)

set_target_properties(helloworld_static PROPERTIES LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC 1)
set(CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES ".a")

find_library(LIBDL_LIBRARY NAMES dl)
message(STATUS ${LIBDL_LIBRARY})

find_library(RAPP_LIBRARY NAMES rapp REQUIRED)
message(STATUS "${RAPP_LIBRARY}")

find_package(OpenSSL REQUIRED)
message(STATUS "${OPENSSL_LIBRARIES}")

find_package(Boost COMPONENTS system REQUIRED)
set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR})
message(STATUS "${Boost_SYSTEM_LIBRARY}")

find_package(Threads REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(helloworld_static ${RAPP_LIBRARY} 
                                 ${OPENSSL_LIBRARIES} 
								 ${Boost_LIBRARIES}
								 ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT}
								 ${LIBDL_LIBRARY})

set(CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS "${CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS}-static")
set(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} -std=c++1y -Wall -fPIC -Os -s -O2 -march=atom -mtune=atom -mfpmath=sse")```

You could see that we added two lines before starting looking for the libraries:

```
set_target_properties(helloworld_static PROPERTIES LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC 1)
set(CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES ".a")
```

With these lines you force to look for static libraries. 
We added `message` because with that line you can be sure in the `build` part that the system has found the static ones.

`Boost` library has its own params to set up what type you need.

```
find_package(Boost COMPONENTS system REQUIRED)
set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS ON)
set(BUILD_SHARED_LIBS OFF)
include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIR})
```

Besides, making `OpenSSL` static needs to have `ldl` library static too.
This is why we added manually here the `LIBDL_LIBRARY`.

```
find_library(LIBDL_LIBRARY NAMES dl)
message(STATUS ${LIBDL_LIBRARY})
```

And the last difference is the `CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`. Besides the type of c++ that we are going to use
we added some optimization flags especially for NAO which is based on Intel Atom processor.
*Availables since gcc 4.5*

If you need more information about the CMakeLists.txt you can see the `helloworld` tutorial in the begginers tutorial folder.

##Build and Run

Now we have to save and close the files, and we go to the terminal.
In there we'll do the next steps:

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

After all, you'll have your executable in `build/` folder.

Finally, we have to move/copy our executable to NAO robot. 
The easy way to do this is using ssh when you are connected to your robot:

```
scp path/to/your/executable nao@ip_of_your_NAO:/path/to/folder/you/need
```

You'll have to change the values of the paths and IP of the robot.

Now you can run your example in NAO and see all the services that RAPP offers.
